# Timesheet App

## Project Summary  
I delivered a Timesheet App for employees to log work hours and managers to approve them. The system uses Azure AD for authentication and role-based authorization.

Backend RESTful APIs built with ASP.NET Core expose timesheet operations and are secured using Azure AD tokens. The React frontend employs MSAL.js to authenticate users and provide responsive UI.

## Key Features  
- Azure AD authentication and role-based authorization.  
- Time entry, editing, and approval workflows.  
- Reporting dashboard for managers.  
- React frontend integrated with Azure AD login.  
- Secure backend APIs with Entity Framework Core and SQL Server.  
- Hosted on Azure App Services.

## Technologies Used  
- React + MSAL.js  
- ASP.NET Core Web API + Azure AD  
- Entity Framework Core + Azure SQL Database  
- Azure App Service

## How I Delivered It  
- Configured Azure AD applications and roles for employees and managers.  
- Designed database schema and EF Core migrations.  
- Developed secure API endpoints for timesheet management.  
- Built React components with authentication and state management.  
- Deployed both frontend and backend to Azure.  
- Created detailed documentation for end users and developers.
